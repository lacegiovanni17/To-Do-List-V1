  First thing's first☝️: Say goodbye to written to-do-list. Everyone loves
  checking things off a to-do list—but if it’s not done right, your to-do list
  can cause more harm than good. In amiapps we offer concrete solution to help you
  set your to-do’s up for success, including how to effectively capture,
  organize, and prioritize tasks. Use this awesome webapp to take your own list to 
  the next level, so you can stop worrying about misplaced notes and start checking
  things off.
  A to-do list📝 is just a list of things you have to-do. That means
  basically anything and everything can be on your to-do list—but just because
  you’ve written your to-dos down doesn’t mean your to-do list is actually
  useful. Effectively tracking when your work is due can help you prioritize and
  get great work done. But too often, that list of work to-dos is disorganized
  and disconnected from the actual work you’re doing—which leads to less clarity
  and more work about work. The good news is, writing a to-do list doesn’t have
  to be an exercise in futility. Take control of your to-dos with this awesome 😁
  webapp specially curated for your needs.
